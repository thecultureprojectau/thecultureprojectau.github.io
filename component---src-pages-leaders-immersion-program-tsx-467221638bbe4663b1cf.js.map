<Col>\n          The Culture Project (CP) is a movement of young Australians who want\n          to build a new culture: a culture where we have the skills, graces and\n          friendships to become the people that we were made to be. A culture\n          where people know who they are, why they matter, and have deep purpose\n          in their day-to-day lives. A culture where couples and marriages\n          aren’t fragile and confusing but getting stronger and more beautiful\n          with time.\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      <Row responsiveLayoutColReverse>\n        <Col>\n          <H1Red>How does the Leaders Immersion Program fit in?</H1Red>\n          The Leaders Immersion Program (the LP for short) is at the heart of\n          the Culture Project. It’s a 12 month program designed for 18-30 year\n          olds who are studying or working casually/part-time. The LP is a\n          deep-dive into how to become the person that you were made to be, how\n          to build real friendships and relationships, and how to start building\n          a better culture today. Those doing the LP are called Culture Project\n          Leaders (CP Leaders).\n        </Col>\n        <Col>\n          <center>\n            <img src={howDoesTheLPYearFitInImg} width={300} />\n          </center>\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      <Row className={styles.whatWillIReceiveCPLeaderContainer}>\n        <Col className={styles.whatWillIReceiveCPLeaderContainerCol}>\n          <H1Red>What will I receive as a CP Leader?</H1Red>\n          CP Leaders receive a lot - to bless CP Leaders is the first purpose of\n          the Culture Project.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          In November/January you will receive over four weeks of live-in\n          community time where you’ll develop new friendships, go deeper in\n          prayer, learn about yourself, learn how to build something meaningful,\n          and learn about how our minds and hearts work. In this time you’ll\n          also be trained in support raising (fundraising).\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          Then from February to November, you’ll receive weekly continued\n          formation and community time, as well as regular support from a core\n          leader. There will also be an Interior Integration Retreat during the\n          year.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          All of this is completely free. The cost of providing this\n          accommodation, studies, food, support and materials for each CP Leader\n          is $30,000, however we believe that each human life is infinitely\n          worth more than this, which is why we make this gift to each leader.\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      <Row className={styles.whatWillIContributeCPLeaderContainer}>\n        <Col className={styles.whatWillIContributeCPLeaderContainerCol}>\n          <H1Red>What will I contribute as a CP Leader?</H1Red>\n          CP Leaders will be asked to give back as well. This is the second\n          purpose of the Culture Project: we want to bless people beyond those\n          doing the LP because we want to spread as far as possible this message\n          of our value, purpose, and the graces and skills necessary to live\n          great things. This is the bigger picture of CP - to truly build this\n          movement of young people.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          Therefore, CP Leaders will be supported in running the following\n          outreach activities: personal support raising and communications, the\n          Young Adult Series or School Outreach, and the Spring Conference.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          Through these activities, CP leaders will discover their gifts and\n          gain valuable experience in areas like public speaking,\n          communications, logistics and many others.

In\n          the LP, we both receive a lot for free (which is much more than we\n          give), and we also learn to give generously without counting time.\n          However, we know that people need money to live a normal life and so\n          there is some remuneration.\n        </Col>\n        <Col>\n          <center>\n            <img src={isItPaidImg} alt=\"Wanderlust Series\" width={500} />\n          </center>\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      <Row>\n        <H1Red>Should I do the Leaders Immersion Program?</H1Red>\n      </Row>\n      <Row responsiveLayoutColReverse>\n        <Col>\n          Great question! It depends what you’re looking for in life.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          If you’re looking to make some money, or for not much to change in\n          your life, or if you’re heavily focused on something else right now\n          and don’t have head-space for other things, the LP is probably not for\n          you (but you’re still extremely welcome at any other CP event!).\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          However, if you want to live a year unlike any other, grow closer to\n          God, challenge yourself, grow as a person, develop leadership skills,\n          form deep friendships, be part of something bigger than yourself and\n          become a blessing to others, then it may well be for you.
